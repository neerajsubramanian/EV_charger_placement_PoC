# Utilities.py 

- Program that works with reading and writing the text files in the project
- Has functions that can be called to calculate the distance matrices
- Has a fucntion to draw the distance Graph using networkx (based on the minimum distance constraint for the project)

Notes:

- commented out the function call in visualization.py -> will use the function in the n_final branch with obj_constr.py post-solving.
